<<'COMMENT'

This is a script that wraps the activation of git. It is supposed to wrap activation
of stuff like 'git ls-files'. It will not scream bloody murder if the current directory
is not a git folder. DO NOT USE THIS AS A GENERAL GIT WRAPPER SINCE ERRORS ARE GOOD
IF THIS IS NOT A GIT FOLDER.

COMMENT

if [[ -d .git ]]; then
	git $*
fi
