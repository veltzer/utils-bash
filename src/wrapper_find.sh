<<'COMMENT'

This is a script which wraps the activation of find. The only difference
is that it does not scream bloody murder if the directory he is asked
to search in (first argument) is non existant. In that case he simply says
nothing (read as returns an empty file set). In case the directory does
exist it simply calls find with the rest of the arguments.

if [[ -d $1 ]]; then
	find $*
